# Source Availability & Safety Notice

PlayFair Dude is **source-available indefinitely** as part of its commitment
to transparency, auditability, and ethical security research.

However, this transparency is not unconditional.

---

## 🔓 Default State — Public Source Availability

Under normal circumstances:
- The source code remains publicly visible
- Access is provided for review, learning, and ethical research
- No usage rights are granted beyond viewing (see LICENSE)

Transparency is the default.

---

## ⚠️ Conditional Restriction Clause

PlayFair Dude reserves the right to **restrict public access** to some or all
of the source code **if a credible risk is identified**, including but not limited to:

- The code being used to enable exploits or cheating
- The code being used for harassment, surveillance, or harm
- Hackers using the code to adapt or bypass integrity systems
- Modifications that meaningfully lower the cost of abuse
- Real-world or digital self-harm risks linked to misuse
- Legal or platform safety obligations

This is a **protective measure**, not a commercialization strategy.

---

## 🔐 Restricted Access Model (If Triggered)

If public access is restricted:
- The project does NOT become closed or proprietary in spirit
- Access may be granted privately to:
  - Verified security researchers
  - Trusted developers
  - Academic institutions
  - Platform or safety partners

Access decisions are made case-by-case with safety as the priority.

---

## 🧭 Governance Principle

Transparency exists to protect people — not to empower harm.

If full public visibility becomes a liability to player safety,
PlayFair Dude will choose **responsibility over exposure**.

---

## 📌 Summary

- Source-available forever is the intent
- Public access is the default
- Safety overrides visibility when necessary
- No mass secrecy, no silent misuse

This notice exists to set clear expectations and protect all parties involved.
