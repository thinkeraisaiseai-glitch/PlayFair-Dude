# PlayFair Dude — Public API (v0.1)

This document defines the **stable public interface** exposed to developers
integrating PlayFair Dude into their Roblox experiences.

This API is **locked for v0.1**. Any breaking changes require a major version bump.

This file is **documentation-only** and does not contain executable code.

---

## Module Name

**PlayFairDude**

Distributed as a **Server-side ModuleScript**.

Client-side usage is explicitly unsupported.

---

## Design Intent

The public API is intentionally small and explicit to ensure:

- Predictable behavior
- Developer trust
- Minimal misuse surface
- Strong privacy guarantees

The API exposes **observability**, not enforcement.

---

## Initialization

### PlayFairDude.init(configTable)

Initializes PlayFair Dude with a developer-provided configuration table.

Rules:
- Must be called exactly once
- Server-side only
- Safe-fail behavior (never crashes the server)
- No observers start automatically

Returns:
- boolean  
  - `true` → initialization successful  
  - `false` → invalid or unsafe configuration

---

## Runtime Controls

### PlayFairDude.start()

Starts all enabled observers, aggregators, and evaluators.

Behavior:
- Begins metric collection
- Does not modify gameplay
- Does not interact with players
- Does not export data automatically unless configured

Calling `start()` without successful initialization has no effect.

---

### PlayFairDude.stop()

Stops all observers and exporters.

Behavior:
- Pauses metric collection
- Retains in-memory aggregated data
- Does not delete historical summaries

Useful for:
- Maintenance windows
- Live debugging
- Temporary suspension of analytics

---

## Reporting & Inspection

### PlayFairDude.getSnapshot()

Returns an **anonymous integrity snapshot** representing the current system state.

Returned structure (conceptual):

    {
      timestamp = number,
      metrics = {
        SIAR = number
      },
      alertCount = number
    }

Properties:
- Aggregated only
- No player identifiers
- Safe for logs, dashboards, or exports
- Represents system stress, not violations

---

### PlayFairDude.getAlerts()

Returns **threshold-based alerts** generated by the evaluator.

Alerts represent **integrity stress signals**, not accusations.

Returned structure (conceptual):

    {
      alerts = [
        {
          metric = "SIAR",
          value = number,
          threshold = number,
          timestamp = number
        }
      ]
    }

Alert guarantees:
- No usernames or display names by default
- No client-side data
- No automatic enforcement actions
- Alerts may exist without any malicious behavior

---

## Safety & Privacy Guarantees

This API guarantees the following invariants:

- No client memory inspection
- No packet interception
- No identity exposure by default
- No automated punishment
- No gameplay modification
- No platform safeguard bypassing

PlayFair Dude observes **systems**, not individuals.

---

## Failure Behavior

PlayFair Dude is designed to fail safely.

If:
- Configuration is invalid
- Metrics are misconfigured
- Exporters fail
- Thresholds are unreachable

Then:
- The system silently degrades
- No crashes occur
- No player impact happens

---

## Governance Note

Any future API expansion must:
- Preserve anonymity by default
- Remain server-side
- Be explicitly opt-in
- Pass ethical and safety review

This API exists to **inform**, not to police.
