# PlayFair Dude

PlayFair Dude is an open-source, developer-opt-in **integrity transparency toolkit**
for Roblox experiences.

It helps developers understand **how their games behave under abnormal or
exploit-like conditions** using anonymous, aggregated, server-side metrics.

> We don’t watch players.  
> We observe systems.

into game integrity — without surveillance, exploitation, or secrecy.
