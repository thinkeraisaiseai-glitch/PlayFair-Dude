# PlayFair Dude — Data Policy

## 1. Default Data Collection

Collected:
- Aggregated server integrity metrics
- Time-windowed anomaly counts

Never collected:
- Usernames or display names
- Chat messages
- IP addresses
- Device or hardware identifiers
- Client memory or processes

---

## 2. Anonymity First

All metrics are anonymous by default.

Player-linked data:
- Disabled by default
- Stored only in volatile memory
- Never exported automatically

---

## 3. Threshold-Based Alerts

Alerts are generated only when:
- Transparent thresholds are exceeded
- Developer has enabled alerting

Alerts do NOT equal accusations.

---

## 4. Emergency Anonymous Data Reveal Policy

Player-linked data may be disclosed **only if ALL are true**:
1. A lawful, written request from the platform owner or legal authority
2. A clearly defined and limited scope
3. Disclosure is private — never public

No mass data release. Ever.
