# PlayFair Dude — Ethics Charter

We believe:
- Security without transparency is theater
- Privacy is a right, not a feature
- Tools shape behavior — so restraint matters

This project will NEVER:
- Enable exploitation
- Assist cheating
- Circumvent platform safeguards
- Perform mass surveillance
- Monetize player data

If a feature harms players, it does not ship.
